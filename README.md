Project Description
The goal of this project is to predict the median income of a Census Tract, and find suitable places to open 'Basic' and 'Premium' store based on median Income of each census tract.

This porject first Compares the clusters obtained by K-Means and BIRCH.

Next, the project tries different numbers of clusters, and for each cluster, the project uses Gradiant Boosting Regressor, Random Forrest, Linear Regression,Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, KNN Regressor, Artificial Neural Network, and Decision Tree to make final prediction.

The project is capable of finding the overall optimal number of clusters and the optimal regressor model for each cluster within the optimal clusters, the criteria used is MSE.
